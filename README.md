I want to use the data scraper for some hobby F1 analysis. All props to
psychemedia for the original code.

Original Readme:

A series of routines for processing FIA/F1 timing data with a view to producing:

- statistical analyses of timing sheet data
- visualisations of timing sheet data
- an automated commentary/review system based on timing data analysis
